# Currency Conversion Data Adapter

Currency Conversion is a JS library that you can use to convert currency exchange rates. You can perform conversions either with one currency pair or perform multiple conversions through a single API call. You can use a data adapter to provide exchange rates, configuration settings, and so on.

The data adapter provides the library with access to relevant exchange rates and configurations. You use the data adapter to send currency exchange rates to the library.

At runtime, the conversion library interacts with the data adapter by calling the relevant methods to provide the information you request.
